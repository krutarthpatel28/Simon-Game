# Simon Game ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the **Simon Game**, a modern version of the classic memory game. Test your memory by repeating the pattern of button flashes in the correct sequence. Each level gets progressively more challenging!

## ðŸ’¡ How to Play:
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the buttons flash in a sequence.
3. Click the buttons in the same order to move to the next level.
4. If you press the wrong button, the game will be over.
5. Challenge yourself to reach the highest level you can!

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic and event handling.
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the buttons and layout, as well as visual effects.
- **Audio**: Different sound effects for each button, including a "wrong" sound for incorrect input.
